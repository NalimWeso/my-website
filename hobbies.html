                    <strong>Programming is a beautiful thing.</strong> When I got into coding, I couldn't tear myself
                    away. Initially, learning, though challenging, yielded positive results. Day by day, I am incredibly
                    proud of the progress I'm making and strive for further development. New ideas and improvements for
                    my projects constantly circulate in my mind, and I want to implement them as quickly as possible.
                    Before bedtime, I devise additional lines of code, eagerly anticipating the next day to sit down at
                    the computer and see if what crossed my mind will actually work. I aspire to pursue a career as a
                    programmer, and I am confident that I will achieve this dream.

                    <strong>I love cinema.</strong> It has raised me, shaped my artistic tastes, developed me
                    emotionally, and allowed me to connect with many people who are now my best friends. I don't just
                    consider it entertainment – for me, it's also the highest form of art that surpasses books and
                    games. The language of cinema is the most perfect way to tell a story. No matter what stage of life
                    I am in, films will always be a part of me. From big blockbusters full of exploding cars to artistic
                    postmodern avant-garde productions, when done properly, the art of filmmaking provides incredible
                    moments and experiences.

                    <strong>Games are an art form.</strong> While they may not hold as high a place for me as cinema
                    does, I am still incredibly fascinated by the possibilities this medium provides. There are worlds
                    to discover, characters to get to know, and adventures to experience. Games offer more than just
                    entertainment – they create an opportunity to encounter genuine, authentic emotions. The countless
                    hours spent reveling in virtual beauty are the moments when I derive joy from playing and living
                    through stories. They serve as a source of inspiration and reflection. Games hold a significant
                    place in my life, providing a captivating way to partake in unique stories.
